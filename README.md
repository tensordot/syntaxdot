# SyntaxDot

## Introduction

**SyntaxDot** is a sequence labeler and dependency parser using
[Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) networks. SyntaxDot models can
be trained from scratch or using pretrained models, such as
[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2) or
[XLM-RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116).

In principle, SyntaxDot can be used to perform any sequence labeling
task, but so far the focus has been on:

* Part-of-speech tagging
* Morphological tagging
* Topological field tagging
* Lemmatization
* Named entity recognition

## Features

* Input representations:
  - Word pieces
  - Sentence pieces
* Flexible sequence encoder/decoder architecture, which supports:
  * Simple sequence labels (e.g. POS, morphology, named entities)
  * Lemmatization, based on edit trees
  * Simple API to extend to other tasks
* Dependency parsing using deep biaffine attention and MST decoding.
* Multi-task training and classification using scalar weighting.
* Encoder models:
  * Transformers
  * Finetuning of BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, ALBERT, and SqueezeBERT models
* Model distillation
* Deployment:
  * Standalone binary that links against PyTorch's `libtorch`
  * Very liberal [license](LICENSE.md)
